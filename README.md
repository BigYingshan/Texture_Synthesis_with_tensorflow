# Texture_Synthesis_with_tensorflow
This is an undergraduate research project that try to synthesis textures by using deep learning.
Code to synthesise textures using convolutional neural networks as described in the paper "Texture Synthesis Using Convolutional Neural Networks" (Gatys et al., NIPS 2015) (http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.07376).
